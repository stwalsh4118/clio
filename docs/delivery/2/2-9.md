# 2-9 Add error handling and logging

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Add comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the Cursor conversation capture system. This ensures the system operates stably, provides useful diagnostics, and handles errors gracefully without crashing.

## Status History

| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| 2025-11-14 22:41:32 | Created | N/A | Proposed | Task file created | System |

## Requirements

1. Add error handling to all components (discovery, watcher, parser, session, exporter, project detection, updater)
2. Log errors with appropriate levels (error, warn, info, debug)
3. Continue operation despite individual component failures
4. Log capture activity for debugging
5. Handle Cursor log format changes gracefully
6. Skip corrupted log files with warnings
7. Log system events (session start/end, file captures, etc.)
8. Provide useful error messages for troubleshooting
9. Use structured logging (consistent format)

## Implementation Plan

1. Review all cursor capture components:
   - Discovery service (task 2-2)
   - Watcher service (task 2-3)
   - Parser (task 2-4)
   - Session tracker (task 2-5)
   - Exporter (task 2-6)
   - Project detector (task 2-7)
   - Updater (task 2-8)
2. Add error handling to each component:
   - Wrap errors with context
   - Return errors instead of panicking
   - Handle nil pointers and edge cases
3. Add logging throughout:
   - Use existing logging infrastructure (from PBI 1)
   - Log at appropriate levels:
     - Error: Component failures, corrupted files
     - Warn: Skipped files, format variations, recoverable issues
     - Info: Session start/end, file captures, important events
     - Debug: Detailed operation flow, file paths, parsing details
4. Implement graceful degradation:
   - Continue watching even if individual files fail to parse
   - Continue operation if project detection fails (use "unknown")
   - Continue operation if export fails (log and retry)
5. Handle specific error cases:
   - Cursor log directory not found: Log error, don't crash
   - Corrupted log files: Log warning, skip file
   - Permission errors: Log error, continue with other files
   - Disk full: Log error, pause exports
   - Format changes: Log warning, attempt to parse anyway
6. Add structured logging:
   - Include component name in log messages
   - Include relevant context (file path, session ID, etc.)
   - Use consistent log format
7. Add metrics/logging for monitoring:
   - Count of files processed
   - Count of errors encountered
   - Count of sessions created
   - Processing time for operations
8. Write tests for error scenarios

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Verify error handling and logging work correctly throughout the system.

**Test Scope**:
- Error handling in all components
- Logging at appropriate levels
- Graceful degradation
- Error recovery

**Environment & Setup**:
- Unit tests with error injection
- Integration tests with error scenarios

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. Handle missing Cursor log directory gracefully
2. Handle corrupted log files without crashing
3. Handle permission errors gracefully
4. Handle disk full errors gracefully
5. Log errors with appropriate context
6. Continue operation after individual failures
7. Log capture activity correctly
8. Handle format changes gracefully
9. Provide useful error messages

**Success Criteria**:
- All errors handled gracefully
- Logging provides useful diagnostics
- System continues operating despite errors
- Error messages are helpful for troubleshooting
