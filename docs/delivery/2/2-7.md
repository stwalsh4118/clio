# 2-7 Implement project detection mechanism

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Implement a mechanism to detect which project a conversation belongs to. This is critical for organizing conversations into the correct project subdirectories and grouping them into sessions.

## Requirements

1. Detect project name from conversation content or metadata
2. Support multiple detection strategies (fallback chain)
3. Handle cases where project cannot be determined
4. Use project name for directory organization
5. Use project name for session grouping
6. Normalize project names (handle special characters, paths, etc.)

## Implementation Plan

1. Design project detection service:
   - Location: `internal/cursor/project.go`
   - Package: `cursor`
2. Define detection strategies (in priority order):
   - Strategy 1: Extract from Cursor log metadata (if available from research)
   - Strategy 2: Parse from conversation content (file paths, project references)
   - Strategy 3: Track active Cursor workspace (if accessible)
   - Strategy 4: Use configured project mapping (if user configures)
   - Strategy 5: Default to "unknown" or "default" project
3. Implement project detector interface:
   ```go
   type ProjectDetector interface {
       DetectProject(conv Conversation) (string, error)
       NormalizeProjectName(name string) string
   }
   ```
4. Implement metadata extraction (if available):
   - Extract project field from Cursor log metadata
   - Use workspace path if available
5. Implement content-based detection:
   - Parse file paths mentioned in conversation
   - Extract project name from common patterns (git repo names, directory names)
   - Look for project references in messages
6. Implement workspace tracking (if possible):
   - Monitor active Cursor workspace
   - Map workspace to project name
7. Implement project name normalization:
   - Remove special characters that aren't filesystem-safe
   - Convert to lowercase or consistent case
   - Handle path separators
   - Limit length if needed
8. Handle unknown projects:
   - Use "unknown" or "default" as fallback
   - Allow user to configure project mapping later
9. Write unit tests for detection strategies

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Verify project detection correctly identifies project from various sources.

**Test Scope**:
- Metadata extraction
- Content-based detection
- Project name normalization
- Fallback handling

**Environment & Setup**:
- Unit tests with sample conversations
- Test with various project name formats

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. Detect project from metadata if available
2. Detect project from file paths in conversation
3. Detect project from git repository references
4. Detect project from directory names
5. Normalize project names correctly
6. Handle special characters in project names
7. Fallback to "unknown" when project cannot be determined
8. Handle multiple detection strategies (try each in order)

**Success Criteria**:
- Project detected from available sources
- Project names normalized correctly
- Fallback works when detection fails
- Detection strategies work in priority order
