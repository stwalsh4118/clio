# 1-2 Set up Cobra CLI framework with root command

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Install and configure the Cobra CLI framework, create the root command structure, and set up the command scaffolding. This provides the foundation for all CLI commands that will be implemented in subsequent tasks.

## Status History

| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| 2025-11-14 01:41:47 | Created | N/A | Proposed | Task file created | System |
| 2025-01-14 16:30:00 | Status Change | Proposed | Done | Task completed - Cobra CLI framework integrated with root command and placeholder subcommands | AI Agent |

## Requirements

1. Add Cobra dependency to go.mod
2. Create root command structure using Cobra
3. Set up command scaffolding for future commands (start, stop, status, config, etc.)
4. Configure root command with appropriate name, description, and version
5. Ensure root command displays help text correctly
6. Set up command structure to support subcommands

## Implementation Plan

1. Add Cobra dependency: `go get github.com/spf13/cobra`
2. Create `internal/cli/` directory for CLI-related code
3. Create `internal/cli/root.go` with root command definition:
   - Command name: "clio"
   - Short description: "Capture and analyze development insights"
   - Long description: Detailed description of the tool
4. Create `internal/cli/cmd.go` or similar to initialize and execute root command
5. Update `cmd/clio/main.go` to call root command execution
6. Create placeholder subcommand structures (start, stop, status, config) that can be implemented later
7. Test that `clio --help` and `clio --version` work correctly

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Verify Cobra CLI framework is correctly integrated and root command functions properly.

**Test Scope**:
- Cobra dependency installation
- Root command creation
- Help and version commands
- Command structure

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. `go get` successfully installs Cobra dependency
2. Root command can be executed and shows help text
3. `clio --help` displays correct help information
4. `clio --version` displays version information (if configured)
5. Command structure supports adding subcommands
6. Invalid commands show appropriate error messages

**Success Criteria**:
- Cobra dependency is added to go.mod
- Root command executes without errors
- Help text is displayed correctly
- Command structure is ready for subcommand implementation

## Verification

- [x] Cobra dependency added to go.mod
- [x] Root command created in `internal/cli/root.go`
- [x] `cmd/clio/main.go` executes root command
- [x] `clio --help` displays help text
- [x] Command structure supports subcommands
- [x] Project compiles without errors

## Files Modified

- `go.mod` (updated with Cobra dependency)
- `go.sum` (updated)
- `internal/cli/root.go` (new)
- `internal/cli/cmd.go` (new, or similar structure)
- `cmd/clio/main.go` (updated to use Cobra)
