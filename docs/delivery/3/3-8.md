# 3-8 Add error handling and logging for git operations

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Add comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the git capture system to ensure robust operation. Handle git repository errors gracefully, log operations appropriately, and ensure the system continues operating despite individual repository failures.

## Requirements

1. Handle git repository errors gracefully:
   - Corrupted repositories
   - Missing repositories (moved or deleted)
   - Permission errors
   - Invalid repository paths
2. Handle git command/operation failures:
   - Failed repository open
   - Failed commit access
   - Failed diff generation
   - Network errors (for remote operations)
3. Add comprehensive logging throughout git capture system:
   - Repository discovery operations
   - Polling operations
   - Commit extraction operations
   - Diff extraction operations
   - Export operations
   - Errors and warnings
4. Continue operation despite individual repository errors:
   - Skip problematic repositories
   - Log errors but don't crash
   - Retry logic where appropriate
5. Use existing logging infrastructure from `internal/logging`
6. Follow logging patterns from PBI 2 (Cursor capture)

## Implementation Plan

1. Review existing error handling:
   - Check current error handling in git services
   - Identify error-prone operations
   - Identify missing error handling
2. Add error handling to discovery service:
   - Handle inaccessible directories gracefully
   - Log skipped directories with reason
   - Continue discovery despite individual failures
3. Add error handling to poller service:
   - Handle repository open failures
   - Skip repositories that can't be opened
   - Log polling errors per repository
   - Continue polling other repositories
4. Add error handling to extractor service:
   - Handle invalid commit hashes
   - Handle missing commits
   - Handle repository access errors
   - Return errors without crashing
5. Add error handling to diff service:
   - Handle diff generation failures
   - Handle large diff processing errors
   - Continue with other files if one fails
6. Add error handling to exporter service:
   - Handle file I/O errors
   - Handle directory creation failures
   - Handle concurrent write conflicts
   - Log export failures
7. Add logging throughout:
   - Use logger from `internal/logging`
   - Log at appropriate levels:
     - Debug: Detailed operations, file paths
     - Info: Important events (repository discovered, commits found)
     - Warn: Recoverable issues (skipped repos, retries)
     - Error: Failures that need attention
   - Include context in logs (repository path, commit hash, etc.)
8. Implement retry logic where appropriate:
   - Transient errors (file locks, temporary I/O)
   - Exponential backoff for retries
   - Maximum retry limits
9. Update all git service files with error handling and logging

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Verify error handling and logging work correctly throughout the git capture system.

**Test Scope**:
- Error handling
- Logging
- Recovery from errors
- System stability

**Environment & Setup**:
- Use temporary directories and repositories
- Create error scenarios (corrupted repos, missing files, etc.)
- Verify logging output

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. Handle corrupted repository gracefully
2. Handle missing repository gracefully
3. Handle permission errors gracefully
4. Continue operation after repository error
5. Log errors appropriately
6. Log operations at correct levels
7. Retry logic works for transient errors
8. System doesn't crash on individual failures
9. Multiple repository errors handled correctly
10. Logging includes necessary context

**Success Criteria**:
- All error scenarios handled gracefully
- Logging comprehensive and appropriate
- System continues operating after errors
- Errors logged with context
- Retry logic works correctly
