# Infrastructure API

Last Updated: 2025-01-27

## Overview

This document catalogs infrastructure components and reusable code that provide cross-cutting concerns across the application. These components should be reused rather than recreated.

## Infrastructure Components

_No infrastructure components have been implemented yet. This document will be updated as infrastructure is added._

## Planned Infrastructure (from PRD)

The following infrastructure components are planned but not yet implemented:

- Logging systems
- Configuration management (Viper)
- Database connection pooling
- HTTP middleware (if needed)
- Error handling utilities
- Common validation functions

## Rules

- ALWAYS check this document before implementing any infrastructure functionality
- If infrastructure exists, ALWAYS import and use it
- NEVER recreate similar functionality
- When creating or modifying infrastructure, update this document
